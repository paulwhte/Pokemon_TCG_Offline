<h3>A simple playmat for experimenting with old pokemon card decks.</h3>

<p>
    There is not much opportunity these days to conjure up the nostalgia of holding a deck of late 90s Pokemon cards. The official online game only has more recent decks and the physical cards have shot up in price. Here I want to allow a couple of people to build decks and manipulate the cards onscreen like you would in a physical card match.

    <b>Project Goals</b>
    <ul>
        <li>&#9745;Include Base, Jungle, and Fossil sets.</li>
        <li>&#9745;Allow users to build and name decks that are then stored as JSON files locally. The goal is a totally localized experience (currently using a quick chrome plugin to load card images from outside source).</li>
        <li>Play operations:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin match (shuffle decks, select prize cards, draw hands).</li>
            <li>Draw card into hand.</li>
            <li>Drag/drop cards freely.</li>
            <li>Discard card from hand and play mat<li>
            <li>Search and draw from discard pile</li>
            <li>Shuffle deck.</li>
            <li>Snapping to various places on the mat: active pokemon, benched pokemon, attached energy<li>
        </ul>
        <li>QOL Usability Improvements</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve UI to be more intuitive and stop users from making mistakes<li>
            <li>Import/Export data as backup and for sharing.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</p>
